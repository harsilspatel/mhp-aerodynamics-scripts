# mhp-aerodynamics-scripts
I am working closely with the currently Aero team lead -- Viencent He -- to assist the team perform a smooth transition, to perform CFD simulations, from Monash Workstations to MonARCH clusters. Furthermore, I will assist the team automate the process of backing up of the resulting data files to the team drives for the analysis.

We will be reaching out to the monARCH team to help you get access to the clusers. 

This guide, by no means, is an exhaustive list of commands you will need to remember. I will be running induction workshops to help the team get up and running with basic linux commands.

Should you need any further help, please do not hesitate to contact me or Vince on Slack.

## tips
1. Use the `short` run on monARCH if the simulation will be running for less than 24 hours.
2. Try to avoid spaces in the filenames.

## todos
[ ] A script to parameterize some of the variables whcih include, but are not limited to, the running file, number of iterations, force overwriting of the existing files.
